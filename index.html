    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>This site is just for my ramblings, thoughts, ideas, and any useful tips I come across.  They may not be accurate or correct, and may be outdated or very specific.</p>

      <p>My education is in geography and climate change - salt marsh carbon emissions specifically.  But far more clever people are working on that stuff and, anyway,
        being shown that we are harming the environment is not the main issue now.  No, solutions to it are.  Unfortunately, I have no expertise in that area.</p>  
        
      <p>So, these days I have a particular interest in language learning.  I'm ever trying to learn Japanese, and I've taught English for close to a decade now.  
        It's a fastinating area, and I love seeing how languages are constructed!  I love learning and teaching them too!  I'm terrible at the learning bit though.</p>
